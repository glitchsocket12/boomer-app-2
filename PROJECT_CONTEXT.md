# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md — Boomer

_Current state of the app, kept deliberately lean. Full narrative history (build stories, bug postmortems, deploy chronicles) lives in `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` — search that by keyword when you need the story behind something; never read it top to bottom. Keep THIS file terse: update facts in place, one line per fact, no narratives. If something is uncertain, mark it "unknown" rather than guessing._

## 1. What Boomer is

A mobile-friendly web app for backing up and staying close to your social memories — an effortless, conversational memory aid for the *texture* of relationships (who was at an event, what's going on with someone's grandkids), so the next time you see someone you're not starting cold. Repositioned 2026-07-19: no longer age-gated to "baby boomers"; still skews toward an established-relationship audience. Think "isolated social network": private archive + relationship-maintenance tool, no browsing other people's profiles. Target user is an extrovert who wants to show up better for people they already value. The founder is non-technical, building hands-on; the product's value is the quality/warmth of what it gives back, not what it stores.

## 2. Stack & Infrastructure

- **Frontend:** React via Vite, TypeScript (accidental — StackBlitz default; keep types light, not strict).
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + auth + Deno Edge Functions). All AI calls happen in Edge Functions only — API keys never reach the browser.
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API, model `claude-sonnet-5` in all functions (an invalid model string fails silently — see guard §12).
- **Speech-to-text:** OpenAI Whisper (`whisper-1`) via the `transcribe` function; needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Supabase secrets (project-wide list under Edge Functions → Secrets). Chosen over the free Web Speech API because that doesn't work in iPhone Safari, and the founder's end goal is an iPhone app.
- **Hosting:** Vercel, live at `https://boomer-app-2-eight.vercel.app/`, auto-deploys on every push to `main` (repo: `github.com/glitchsocket12/boomer-app-2`). `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set in Vercel project settings; Vite bakes them in at build time. Vercel CLI (`npx vercel`) installed as a fallback deploy path.
- **Dev:** local folder, this repo. `npm run dev` (port 5173; respects `PORT` for the browser-preview tool), `npm run build`, `npm run test` (Vitest — only covers `src/lib/` pure helpers; zero Edge Function coverage).
- **Deploying Edge Functions:** `npx supabase functions deploy <name>` with a founder-provided Personal Access Token, or paste the file into the Supabase dashboard and click Deploy. `supabase/functions/_shared/` is bundled automatically.
- **Schema changes:** SQL handed to the founder to run in the SQL Editor (saved under `supabase/migrations_manual/`), or applied directly via the Management API (`POST /v1/projects/{ref}/database/query` with the same access token).
- **Token-free live verification (no login needed):** a column exists if PostgREST returns 200 (400 if not, via anon key); a function is deployed if its URL returns its own error/401 rather than Supabase's `NOT_FOUND`.

`App.tsx` is the traffic controller: auth state, tab nav (Home/People/Events/Groups), a generic `navStack: Crumb[]` breadcrumb stack any page can push person/group/event crumbs onto, persisted to sessionStorage (`boomer-nav`) so refresh stays put. Voice input + AutoGrowTextarea are on every conversational text box (Home, event chat, group chat, fact bar).

## 4. Edge Functions (`supabase/functions/`)

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `converse` | **The main unified brain** (Home). Per turn decides: answer question / capture new moment(s — `moments` array, multiple per turn supported) / update moment / rename placeholder / name+nickname corrections / create+tag groups / relationship signals / logs recall attempts to `search_log`. Knows the self person (`is_self`) and their known relationships (`_shared/selfContext.ts`) so "my mom"/"my parents" resolve without a named subject (2026-07-20). Quirk: model occasionally replies in prose instead of the JSON envelope — falls back to showing that prose as the reply. |
| `add-fact` | Classifies fact-bar text: name/nickname update, birthday/anniversary (upserts `reminders`), or plain note. Group inference (`group_signal`, high=auto/medium=ask). Relationship handling via `_shared/relationships.ts`. A fact typed on the self profile's own page already resolves "my X" correctly with no special-casing (the subject is always whichever profile is being viewed). |
| `update-moment` | Event chat. Saves per turn (not on "done"), has full people+events rosters, `moment_field_updates` (when/where/title), `add_groups`, relationship signals, self-person "my X" resolution (2026-07-20). |
| `update-group` | Group chat: rename, members, tag/untag events, member facts (tagged `source_group_id`), relationship signals, self-person "my X" resolution (2026-07-20). Saves per turn. |
| `person-facts` | Extracts Key Facts from a person's notes — explicitly stated only, never inferred. Cached in `people.key_facts`; `{refresh: true}` regenerates. Failure paths return cached facts, never wipe. Linked categories (spouse/siblings/parents/kids) resolve to person chips on exact-full-name match OR a `relationships` table row (2026-07-20, additive — never overrides an AI-extracted fact, just fills in a linked person the table already knows about). Has its OWN category vocabulary (not the shared 5-kind enum — known mismatch, read-only so harmless). |
| `summarize-group` | One-sentence group description → cached `groups.summary`. Members = explicit roster only, never event attendees. |
| `summarize-moment` | 2-4 sentence first-person event summary → cached `moments.summary`. Cleared/regenerated when notes change. |
| `suggest-prompts` | 3 suggestion cards for Home → cached in `home_suggestions` table; regenerates only when data is newer than cache or on manual refresh. |
| `transcribe` | Whisper speech-to-text. |

**Shared module** `_shared/relationships.ts`: the 5 relationship kinds (spouse/sibling/parent/child/partner), reciprocal notes written on BOTH sides (`INVERSE_RELATIONSHIP` map — incl. when a suggestion banner is confirmed, not just an immediate confident match, fixed 2026-07-20), dedupe on an EXACT match against the deterministic note text (not a loose name+keyword heuristic — the loose version used to false-positive on the SUBJECT's own original sentence and silently block their own reciprocal note, fixed 2026-07-20, see PROJECT_HISTORY §13), confident-match = name-as-typed exactly equals full name on file (else a suggest-don't-assert banner), siblings named together in one signal also link to EACH OTHER not just to the subject (direct write when confident, exact-full-name lookup at confirm-time otherwise — 2026-07-20), shared-parent inference suggestions, last-name inference for people created from relationship mentions (`inferLastNameFromSignals`, also called by the direct `new_people`/`add_people` creation paths). Every confident/pairwise note write here now ALSO dual-writes the matching row into the `relationships` table (2026-07-20, via `_shared/relationshipsTable.ts`'s `upsertRelationship` — takes a `userId` param now). Used by `converse`/`add-fact`/`update-moment`/`update-group` so relationship behavior is identical at all four entry points. `chat` and `search` functions were deleted 2026-07-19 (superseded by `converse`).

**Shared module** `_shared/relationshipsTable.ts` (2026-07-20): the `relationships` table read/write layer — `upsertRelationship` (spouse/sibling/partner symmetric & normalized a<b by id sort; `parent` directional, not normalized) and `getRelationshipsForPerson` (all of one person's links, either side of a row, in one shape). Mirrored on the frontend at `src/lib/relationshipsTable.ts` (Deno can't import across the Vite boundary) — keep both in sync if the table shape changes. `_shared/selfContext.ts`: `findSelfPerson`/`buildSelfInstruction` — builds the "my mom/dad" instruction paragraph for `converse`/`update-moment`/`update-group`, appended to each function's own DYNAMIC per-user tier (never the stable tier — the self person's name/relationships are per-user data and would otherwise bust the globally-shared stable-instructions cache).

## 5. AI cost & caching architecture (see CLAUDE.md rule 3 — non-negotiable)

- **DB-cached outputs** (generate once, serve from a column, refresh on data change or manual button): `people.key_facts`, `groups.summary`, `moments.summary`, `home_suggestions`. Never re-call the API for unchanged content.
- **Prompt caching, tiered by volatility (restructured 2026-07-20):** `converse`/`update-moment`/`update-group` each split their system prompt into ordered tiers, stable-to-volatile, each its own `cache_control` breakpoint: fully-static instructions (zero interpolated data) → a roster tier (people/groups/other-items — changes rarely, 1-hour TTL) → a hot-write tier (moments for `converse`; this-item's-own-state for `update-moment`/`update-group` — default 5-minute TTL) → today's date last, uncached (previously sat at the FRONT of one combined block and busted the whole thing daily). `add-fact`/`person-facts` also cache-marked. `summarize-group`/`summarize-moment` deliberately have NO markers (under the ~1024-token minimum — nothing to gain).
- **Every roster/moment query in these functions has an explicit `.order()`** — Postgres row order is otherwise nondeterministic and silently busts the cache-prefix match. Removing one kills caching with no error.
- Verify with `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` in responses when touching this code (confirmed nonzero live 2026-07-19; the 2026-07-20 redeploy is confirmed live via §10's 401 check — re-verify the usage field itself next time real chat traffic hits it).
- **Conversation thread also cached (2026-07-20):** `_shared/promptCache.ts`'s `withMessageCacheBreakpoint` adds a `cache_control` marker to the last message in `messages` — the 4th and final breakpoint in each function (max 4/request) — so the growing back-and-forth itself gets cached too, not just the archive/roster tiers above. Previously the system-prompt tiers could hit cache while the whole message thread still re-paid full price every turn.
- **Relationship-extraction fanout, reduced 2026-07-20 (not eliminated):** `_shared/relationships.ts`'s `getRelationNames` now memoizes each person's parent/sibling extraction within one request (previously re-derived the SUBJECT's own list from scratch on every sibling compared against it) and checks `people.key_facts` before ever making a fresh Claude call, falling back to a live call only when Key Facts are empty/missing for that person. Cuts the ~12-call worst case when many siblings/parents are named at once; doesn't remove the ceiling. See PROJECT_HISTORY §14.

## 6. Database (Supabase / Postgres, RLS on everything, scoped to auth.uid())

```
people        id, user_id, name (first), last_name?, nicknames? (comma-separated
              "goes by" list, additive), key_facts jsonb?, key_facts_updated_at?,
              is_self bool (default false, partial unique index per user_id — at most
              one "this is me" profile; excluded from People list/search/Dunbar/
              due-for-update, 2026-07-20), created_at
relationships id, user_id, person_a_id, person_b_id, kind (spouse/sibling/partner —
              symmetric, stored once normalized person_a_id < person_b_id by uuid
              sort; parent — directional, person_a_id IS THE PARENT of person_b_id,
              no separate "child" kind stored), created_at, unique(person_a_id,
              person_b_id, kind) — 2026-07-20, THE shared source of truth for family
              links: `_shared/relationships.ts` dual-writes here alongside its
              reciprocal notes, `person-facts` cross-references it for Key Facts
              linking, `converse`/`update-moment`/`update-group` read it for "my
              mom/dad" resolution, Circle.tsx/FamilyTree.tsx read AND write it
              directly. Backfilled once from existing deterministic reciprocal-note
              text (exact-name match only, best-effort, not exhaustive).
moments       id, user_id, raw_description (user's words only — never assistant
              turns), summary? (AI cache), occasion?, location?, when_text?
              (free-text, kept verbatim), event_date? (AI best-guess real date,
              sorting/display only, NOT ground truth; null = fall back to
              created_at), details jsonb? (open-ended tags by design),
              dismissed_person_ids jsonb [], created_at
notes         id, person_id? , moment_id?, group_id? (CHECK: person_id OR group_id),
              source? ("home" = written by converse), source_group_id? (fact
              captured via a group chat), content, created_at
              — attendance on an event IS the existence of a note with that
              moment_id; untagging nulls moment_id, never deletes.
              ⚠ two FKs to groups: embeds must be qualified
              (groups!notes_source_group_id_fkey) or PostgREST errors (PGRST201).
reminders     id, person_id, label ("Birthday"/"Anniversary"), month, day
              — no year, no automatic sending exists.
groups        id, user_id, name, summary? (AI cache), group_type? (Family/Friend
              group/School/Team/Work, nullable, fixed picker, CHECK-constrained),
              dismissed_person_ids jsonb [], dismissed_group_ids jsonb [], created_at
person_groups person_id + group_id (PK) — THE definition of membership (explicit
              only; event attendees are never members, only suggestions)
group_associations id, group_id_a, group_id_b (symmetric, normalized a<b by UUID
              string sort), created_at
moment_groups moment_id + group_id (PK)
search_log    id, user_id, query_text, matched bool, created_at — one row per
              genuine recall attempt in Home; powers "Recall assists this month"
home_suggestions user_id (PK), suggestions jsonb, updated_at — suggest-prompts cache
```

`dismissed_*` columns only filter suggestion lists; conversational writes never consult them, so a denied person can still be added by name in chat.

## 7. What's built (all live unless noted in §10)

- **Auth:** sign up / log in. Email confirmation DISABLED for testing — must re-enable before real users.
- **Home:** continuous chat (answer/capture/update/correct/group-tag per turn, multiple events per message, never dead-ends — suggests close matches or asks); clickable person/event/group chips on replies with canonical spellings; cached suggestion cards (tap = starts a real conversation); dashboard (People/Events/Groups/Notes counts — People/Events/Groups tiles clickable → jump to that tab, 2026-07-20; Notes tile has no page to link to, Dunbar card → DunbarDetail, Recall-assists card, monthly leaderboard → DueForUpdate). Known gap: the chat thread lives in component state — switching tabs loses it.
- **People:** manual "add person" is a no-form blank shell (2026-07-20, matches Events/Groups — was a first+last form before), search (incl. nicknames), 5 sort options, count in heading.
- **Person profile:** Key Facts (cached, ordered Parents→Spouse→Siblings→Children, exact-match chips), missing-category nudges, notes with hover edit/delete + source labels ("Added through: {event}" / "From: {Group}" / "From Home"), name-edit pencil (first/last name fields, 2026-07-20 — matches Event/Group rename pattern) plus fact bar (AI-classified, still the only path for nickname/birthday/anniversary), Associated Groups hover-untag + search-and-add picker (2026-07-20, matches EventDetail's Affiliated Groups — was read-only before), relationship + new-person + shared-parent + last-name suggestion banners, delete/merge profile (the SEARCHED-FOR record survives; merged-away names fold into nicknames).
- **Groups:** created conversationally OR via manual "add group" (blank shell, no form, 2026-07-20 — recurring affiliations, school/team/unit/workplace/circle, never one-off events); tiles with summary + capped chips; detail page per §3; membership = explicit only; suggestions from event attendance + associated-group rosters; symmetric confirmed group associations; whole-group delete (2026-07-20, the safety net the manual button needed — groups have no dedupe-by-name check the way `converse` does); **Group Types** (2026-07-20): fixed picker (Family/Friend group/School/Team/Work) on GroupDetail, nullable — sets `group_type` instantly, no save button; Groups page has a type filter dropdown + a badge on typed tiles. Manual "add group" now also adds the self person as a member (2026-07-20 fix — previously a group you created yourself, e.g. your own Family group, wouldn't show on "My page" since you weren't in its roster).
- **Events:** browsable, sorted by real-date guess; detail per §3; AI summary regenerates on new detail (only once there's a description to summarize); delete/merge (searched-for survives); group tagging + attendee tagging via chat OR direct search-and-add pickers on the event page (2026-07-20); manual "add event" button (2026-07-20) creates a blank shell and drops straight onto its detail page to build up from there — same "step by step" idea as manual "add person," extended to events/groups.
- **Voice input** on every text box (record → Whisper → text dropped in for review, never auto-sends; no live captions — batch only). **Auto-grow textareas** everywhere.
- **Cross-navigation:** any person/group/event mention anywhere is a chip → detail page, with breadcrumb trail; refresh restores location (sessionStorage).
- **Search boxes** on People/Events/Groups (client-side).
- **"My page" + real family tree + relationships table** (item 32, 2026-07-20 — see §3/§4/§6): a real `is_self` flag + `relationships` table replace the note-text-only inference that used to be the sole source of family data. Circle.tsx ("My page") is real (onboarding to flag/create the self person, live circle grid, "+" writes real facts). FamilyTree.tsx works for ANY person, not just the self person, walking the relationships table live. `person-facts` Key Facts linking and `converse`/`update-moment`/`update-group`'s "my mom/dad" resolution both read the same table now — the "all work together" ask is done, not just the tree UI.
- Demo persona seed data exists ("John & Jane Doe", ~18 people/~22 moments — fake, handwritten UUIDs; don't pattern-match on it).

## 8. Backlog — MASTER LIST (founder's priority list; work order: bugs → quick wins → bigger features)

Items 1–13 (bugs + quick wins) all done 2026-07-18. Also done 2026-07-19: event delete/merge, associated groups, chat layout fix, last-name sort, note source labels, group notes. Also done: 25 (2026-07-20: sibling-group transitive linking + reciprocal-write-on-confirm fix, deployed and confirmed live — see §10); 36 (2026-07-20: manual "add an event" / "add a group" buttons, plus group delete — see §7); 35/Group Types (2026-07-20: `group_type` column + fixed picker on GroupDetail + filter/badge on Groups — see §7); **32 (2026-07-20: real `is_self` flag + `relationships` table, real "My page"/family tree, "my mom/dad" resolution — see §7, DEPLOYED and DB-migrated live, see §10)**.

**Open — bigger features:**
14. Global search bar on every page (decide: text match first vs. semantic — merges with 30).
15. **Relationship-aware smarts** umbrella — partially unblocked by item 32's `relationships` table: "resolve 'my parents'" is DONE (`converse`/`update-moment`/`update-group` all do it now). Still open: answer via family links ("Braden's dog" → spouse's note) — the table can now support this but nothing queries it for that yet; auto-suggest links from note content beyond what already exists; background relationship scanning; approval log on Home.
16. Auto-notes from chat for every person mentioned (events do this; extend everywhere).
17. Long story/voice-note handling (1–2 min recording parsed into all its facts) — chat currently chokes on long stories.
18. Real-time voice transcription (words appear as you speak; Whisper is batch-only — partial option: Web Speech captions on non-iPhone only).
19. Rules engine ("group A + group B ⇒ group C") + group hierarchy visualization.
20. Data viz: family tree, connection map.
21. Internet lookup for added context.
22. Settings page: tile colors, suggestion sensitivity, chat tone, user's own profile/library, terminology library, About.
23. **Security hardening** + honest About-page writeup ("I don't want it to be bullshit") — start from §10's reality, audit first.
24. Family-dynamic variety (half-/step-/adoptive) — **needs founder decision first**: (a) new relationship types vs. (b) qualifier field on the existing 5; qualifier also changes shared-parent inference (ask which parent, not both).
26. Ratings/thumbs feedback loop (tunes suggestions; does not retrain the model).
27. Photo gallery for real (upload/Supabase Storage/tagging; placeholder shipped). True camera-roll sync needs the native iPhone app.
28. Manual + AI-suggested tags on events (schema change).
29. Search within GroupDetail; People filter (criteria undecided).
30. AI/"fuzzy" semantic search (likely merges into 14).
31. **"Memory lane" curated media feed** — requested 2026-07-19. A scrollable, media-driven feed surfacing curated memories (vs. today's specific-lookup mode only); best outcome likely needs real event photos, so probably sequences after item 27 (photo gallery). Already named as a target query mode in §9's product philosophy, just not built yet.
32. ~~User's own profile~~ — **DONE 2026-07-20.** Real `is_self` flag + `relationships` table (shared source of truth for family links), real "My page" (`Circle.tsx`) + real family tree (`FamilyTree.tsx`, works for any person), `person-facts` linking and "my mom/dad" resolution both read the same table — see §3/§4/§6/§7. Full build story in PROJECT_HISTORY §15. Still-open UX questions, not yet resolved: (a) empty relationship categories on "Your circle" shown as invite-to-add vs. hidden until populated, (b) a family tree for a group you're NOT a member of (no "You" tier to anchor on). ~~(c) "+" always targets a tier's first branch when a tier has more than one~~ — **FIXED 2026-07-20**, see item 37.
33. **Refer to the user as "You" instead of "User"** — requested 2026-07-19. E.g. "Your brother is Josh," "Your Mom is Amy" — more conversational/personal than the current third-person "User" phrasing. Likely pairs with item 32 once a user profile exists.
34. **Filterable "View" by event category on the Events page** — requested 2026-07-19. Founder's concern: as event volume grows, big events (weddings) get buried among day-to-day notes (a phone call), so a picklist of categories to narrow the list is needed. Categories would come from a learning/growing list derived from events actually added, not a fixed hardcoded set. Pairs with item 28 (manual + AI-suggested tags on events) — likely the same schema change powers both the tags and this filter view.
35. **Sub-events for multi-day events** — requested 2026-07-19, founder flagged as important. Certain events (e.g. a vacation) span multiple days and generate lots of small sub-memories; needs a way to nest those under a parent event rather than flattening everything into one event or scattering into unrelated standalone events. Adjacent to item 36's now-shipped "add event" flow — a parent-event picker would be a natural addition to that button/page later.
37. ~~Family tree bug scan~~ — **DONE 2026-07-20.** Founder-requested audit of `familyTree.ts`/`FamilyTree.tsx` turned up and fixed: Parents/Grandparents tiers now always render with an add option (previously vanished entirely at zero, unlike Kids — no way to add a first parent from the tree); tree "+" can now add a spouse (previously only ever added a sibling); a person can now show more than one spouse/partner on the tree (previously only the first was shown, others silently dropped); "add grandparent" now offers one option per parent by name instead of silently always attaching to whichever parent was listed first (closes item 32c); `relationships` query now ordered by `created_at` so which parent/spouse a tree branch anchors on is stable across reloads instead of depending on unspecified DB row order. Verified end-to-end against the real `jakevolin@gmail.com` account (Jake Volin's tree — Amy/Steve Volin as parents, Lisa/David Bach as Amy's side, Noah Bach as cousin) including adding a disposable second spouse to confirm multi-spouse rendering, then deleted the test person. **Follow-up fix 2026-07-20:** SVG canvas was a fixed 680px width, so wide trees (many siblings/spouses) overflowed the viewBox and got clipped instead of shown — canvas now sizes to actual content width and scrolls horizontally in its own strip instead of clipping. **Follow-up fix 2026-07-21 (wire connections):** founder-reported, spotted on his own live tree (Amy/Steve Volin as parents). Parent-child connector lines now drop from the marriage-line midpoint of a couple instead of just one parent's box (was: Jake+Josh only visually connected to whichever parent was `primaryParentId`). Aunts/uncles now fetch and render their own spouse (was: hardcoded out entirely, so a married-in aunt/uncle never showed or connected) with no blood-anchor of their own, so they only ever show via the marriage line, never a false ancestor line. Cousins now do the same (fetch + render their own spouse) and their own kids are now included (anchored to the cousin), closing the "cousin's spouse and cousin's kids are invisible" gap. Aunts/uncles and cousins now render on the correct side of their parent (left for `union.a`'s side, right for the trailing spouse's side) instead of all pooling to one side — this both matches a normal family-tree layout and, as a side effect, fixes a geometry bug where the sibling-group bar visually crossed through the other spouse's box. See `src/lib/familyTree.ts`/`src/pages/FamilyTree.tsx`.

**Parked** (don't resurrect unprompted): automatic email reminders (table exists, nothing sends); weather metadata; iPhone Contacts import; "AI should ask deeper follow-ups" thread (feeds 17).

**Small known follow-ups:** align `person-facts`' category vocabulary with the shared 5-kind enum; nicknames stated via `update-moment`/`person-facts` paths aren't written (only lookup); Edge Function test coverage (needs Anthropic/Supabase mocks); no retroactive group backfill for pre-2026-07-15 moments.

## 9. Product & UX decisions (the standing "why")

- **iPhone app is the real end goal** — weigh iPhone Safari support in every web-API choice (this decided Whisper over Web Speech).
- Web/PWA now, not native; email over push (scope); one shared People concept under everything.
- **Talk, don't fill out forms (mostly):** most corrections/dates/nicknames are set conversationally via AI classification (the fact bar), not form fields. Exceptions, kept consistent across Person/Event/Group: rename pencils (name/title fields) and manual group/attendee tagging (search-and-add pickers), plus note edit/delete, merge/delete — these are direct-manipulation controls, not AI-classified.
- **Flexible data over rigid structure** (jsonb `details`, free-text `when_text`): great for AI-driven recall, deliberately bad for structured reporting — don't "clean up" without asking. `event_date` was an explicit founder-approved exception (AI resolves "last week" to a real date for sorting only).
- **Never silently assert an inference.** Relationship links, new people from mentions, shared parents, last names — all "suggest, don't assert" banners unless the match is exact-full-name confident. Key Facts never infer or pad. Exception (founder decision 2026-07-20): siblings named together in the same statement link directly to each other, no suggestion banner — same certainty as the stated pair, not a separate guess.
- **Placeholder people get renamed, not duplicated** ("Clare's mom" → real name = rename). One placeholder per distinct individual.
- Broad questions synthesize everything; never dead-end a miss.
- Membership ≠ attendance: `person_groups` is the only membership truth; attendees of a group's events are suggestions.
- Merges: the record you search for survives; the one you're standing on folds away.
- **Never make the user feel bad about forgetting** — the app is a private pre-event briefing tool, not live assistance. Two query modes: specific lookup (built) and "memory lane" curated overview (NOT built — item toward §8).
- **Input philosophy:** incremental over exhaustive; a fragment is a valid entry; AI carries the cognitive load (confirmation over free recall); "good enough" is the default. Proactive nudges: AI-selected type (action/reflection/memory-mining), trigger mechanism not designed yet.
- Security honesty tiers (item 23): encryption at rest/in transit = claimable now; E2E = roadmap only (conflicts with AI reading content today).

## 10. Pending manual steps, open bugs, cleanup

- ~~`summarize-group` member-conflation prompt fix~~ — **deployed 2026-07-19** (confirmed live: 401, not Supabase's not-found). Still worth regenerating the Sam/Jordan test group's summary (refresh button) to confirm it no longer calls Jordan a member.
- ~~`person-facts` exact-match confidence fix~~ — **deployed 2026-07-19** (confirmed live: 401, not Supabase's not-found). Gus Reynolds's cached Key Facts will still show the stale "Dating: Olivia Gillingham" chip until his profile's Key Facts are refreshed (button, or edit/delete a note).
- ~~Bad data cleanup: wrong "Dating" notes on Gus Reynolds's/Olivia Gillingham's profiles~~ — **checked live 2026-07-19, nothing to clean up.** Olivia Gillingham's profile has zero notes (no reciprocal note was ever actually written there). Gus's profile has one note, "Is dating a girl named Olivia" — that's the intended fallback save from declining the link, not bad data. Gus's Key Facts already show "Dating: Olivia" as plain unlinked text (cache had already regenerated with the `person-facts` fix), confirming the fix is working. Original doc entry was based on the bug description, not a fresh check — worth double-checking claims like this against the live app before carrying them forward.
- ~~Remaining cleanup: test person "Zzztest CacheCheck" + test event~~ — **checked live 2026-07-20, already gone** (a People search for "Zzztest" returns no matches). Founder must have deleted it since the original note; not this session's doing.
- ~~Julia Lacy's "Wyatt" Key Fact showing as text, not a button~~ — **fixed 2026-07-19, no code change.** Her note said "Wyatt" (first name only); Jalen's said "Wyatt Lacy". `person-facts`'s exact-full-name-match rule (§10 above) correctly declined to link the bare first name — same rule, working as intended. Fixed by editing Julia's note to say "Wyatt Lacy" and letting Key Facts regenerate. (A same-session attempt to loosen the matching rule instead was caught and reverted before staying live long — see PROJECT_HISTORY for why that rule must not be loosened.)
- ~~`search_log` table~~ — **confirmed live**: PostgREST returns 200 for `search_log`, `converse` returns 401 (deployed, not platform-not-found), and the production Home dashboard's "Recall assists this month" card shows a real nonzero count (4).
- **Voice mic button**: backend confirmed working; still never click-tested inside the app UI post-fix.
- ~~Cache-tiering + relationship-fanout dedupe (2026-07-20) needs deploying~~ — **deployed and confirmed live 2026-07-20** (`converse`/`update-moment`/`update-group`/`add-fact`, via `npx supabase functions deploy` with a founder-provided token; all 4 return 401, not Supabase's not-found). The same-day message-thread-caching fix (`_shared/promptCache.ts`) landed on disk before this redeploy ran, so it went out in the same batch. See PROJECT_HISTORY §14.
- ~~Sibling-linking fixes need redeploy~~ — **all 3 rounds deployed and confirmed live 2026-07-20** (`add-fact`/`converse`/`update-group`/`update-moment`, via `npx supabase functions deploy` with a founder-provided token; see PROJECT_HISTORY §13 for the full 3-bug story: asymmetric write-on-confirm, siblings-named-together not linking to each other, and the too-loose dedupe check that specifically blocked the SUBJECT of the original sentence from getting their own reciprocal notes). Verified end-to-end with disposable test people (deleted after). Ale/Fede/Manuel Sucre and the full Berzins family (Mark & Margaret, parents; Caroline Volin/Clare Sucre/Patrick Berzins/Bridget Berzins, children) both hand-repaired live via the fact bar — all 6 sibling pairs and 8 parent-child pairs in the Berzins family confirmed bidirectional by direct query.
- ~~Database-wide scrub for the same asymmetric-relationship-note bug~~ — **done 2026-07-20** (see PROJECT_HISTORY §13). Scanned all 417 person-notes against the app's 5 deterministic reciprocal phrasings; found and bulk-fixed 48 asymmetric pairs across the whole database (not just the two reported families) via direct REST insert. Re-scan afterward confirmed zero gaps remain. Deliberately did not attempt fuller transitive closure (two people each linked to a common third person, but not stated as siblings of each other) — that's a new inference, not a stated-fact completion, and risks wrongly asserting full-sibling status in a half-/step-sibling structure (item 24 below is still an open founder decision).
- **Founder cleanup needed: likely duplicate person "David" (no last name) vs. "David Adelstein"** — both have the identical single note "Married to Jill Tullman.", the signature of an accidental duplicate profile rather than two facts. Left unmerged deliberately (found during the scrub above) — merge via the app's own People search + merge-profile feature rather than guessed at.
- **Founder cleanup needed: two separate "Amy Volin" profiles exist** — found 2026-07-20 while verifying the relationships-table build (see PROJECT_HISTORY §15). Not this session's doing and not touched — merge via People search + merge-profile once confirmed which one should survive.
- **Founder cleanup needed: two separate "Barbara Bach" profiles exist** — found 2026-07-20 during the sibling-parent backfill (see PROJECT_HISTORY §16). Not touched — merge via People search + merge-profile once confirmed which one should survive. If Barbara/Bill still don't show connected on the live tree after the 2026-07-21 wire fix (item 37), check this first — the fix only renders relationships that exist on the correct profile; a spouse link on the *other* Barbara duplicate wouldn't be picked up.
- **2026-07-21 family tree wire fix not verified against live data** — this session had no Supabase credentials (no `.env` in the remote container), so it couldn't load Jake's real tree. Verified instead with `npm run build` and a temporary synthetic-data harness (deleted before commit) shaped like the reported bug (a couple with siblings on each side, a married-in aunt/uncle, a cousin with a spouse and kids) rendered and screenshotted in-browser. Worth a live click-through against the real account to confirm, especially the Barbara/Bill case above.
- ~~Siblings now inherit shared parents (2026-07-20, see PROJECT_HISTORY §16)~~ — fixed the bug where adding a sibling via the family tree "+" picker never copied an existing sibling's parents onto the new person. **Deployed and confirmed live 2026-07-20**: frontend fix (`writeRelationship.ts`) via Vercel, edge-function mirror (`add-fact`/`converse`/`update-group`/`update-moment`) via `npx supabase functions deploy` with a founder-provided token — all 4 returned 401 (not platform-not-found) post-deploy, no Cloudflare retries needed this round.
- ~~Relationships table + `is_self` migration + 5 Edge Function redeploy (item 32, 2026-07-20)~~ — **applied and deployed live 2026-07-20** via the Management API + `npx supabase functions deploy` with a founder-provided token (`add-fact`/`converse`/`update-group`/`update-moment`/`person-facts`, 3 of the 5 needed a retry after a transient Cloudflare 502). Backfill landed 75 relationship rows from existing notes. Click-tested end-to-end (My Page onboarding/circle/`+`, family tree render + re-center + `+`) against the real `jakevolin@gmail.com` account with disposable test data, cleaned up after — see PROJECT_HISTORY §15 for the full verification story, including a self-inflicted name-collision near-miss that was fully cleaned up.
- ~~Self missing from groups created before the 2026-07-20 auto-add-self fix~~ — **backfilled 2026-07-20**: one-off script (authenticated as the real `jakevolin@gmail.com` account, RLS-respecting) added the self person to all 22 pre-existing groups that were missing them (only "Volin Family" already had self as a member). Cached group summaries were deliberately NOT invalidated by this backfill, to avoid a 22-call regeneration cost spike (CLAUDE.md rule 3) — a summary will just read as slightly stale until it's naturally refreshed.
- Email confirmation must be re-enabled (with a proper redirect URL) before real users.
- Not production-hardened generally: no 2FA/access-control story, minimal tests.
- **Before assuming a local diff is unfinished work: check what's actually deployed** — Edge Functions have been deployed from the dashboard without commits before (see §2's token-free checks). Also check `git status` for another concurrent session's work before editing.

## 11. Rules for AI assistants working on this repo

1. **The founder is a non-technical beginner** — plain language, no jargon; they can run exact terminal commands and read a file tree conceptually.
2. **Check in before major/architectural decisions.** Routine follow-through (commit/push/doc updates after verified work) needs no sign-off — see CLAUDE.md.
3. **`converse` is the living center of the app** — most product intelligence is its prompt + JSON handling. Extend it rather than building parallel paths.
4. **Prefer whole-file replacement over incremental patching** once a file is complex (track record of dupe-declaration/typo bugs).
5. Respect the flexible-data-model choice (§9) — don't add rigid columns unprompted.
6. This is a working prototype, not a production system (§10).
7. Demo data is fake — don't infer patterns from it.
8. **Token/billing efficiency is a standing rule** — CLAUDE.md rule 3 + §5 here. Never downgrade the model to save money (founder decision only).
9. Keep this doc lean per the header note; append postmortem-worthy narratives to `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` instead.

## 12. Regression guards (hard-won one-liners — full stories in PROJECT_HISTORY.md §9)

- **Silent RLS failure is the house bug:** any Supabase write that only checks `if (data)` fails silently — always check `.error`, and gate every function on a valid `user` up front (401 "log out and back in" on stale sessions). The AI will cheerfully claim it saved when nothing did.
- **Bare first names/nicknames only resolve when unique account-wide** ("two Bobs"); relationship auto-linking additionally requires name-as-typed == full name on file. Any new AI shorthand (group names too) must handle non-unique.
- **Model JSON is never clean:** slice first `{` to last `}`, retry once on parse failure, regex-extract `"reply"` as last resort. Assistant-prefill (`{role:"assistant","{"}`) is NOT supported — hard API error. Give `max_tokens` headroom for the richest turn (converse: 4096) — truncation = silent JSON failure. Remove unused fields from prompt schemas (dead output budget truncated Key Facts).
- **Save per turn, never gate on "done"** — users don't reply to closing questions.
- Build `raw_description` from `role === "user"` messages only (assistant turns can contain retry garbage).
- **Any function resolving user shorthand needs the FULL rosters** (people AND other events) — narrower context than the user's mental model = wrong guesses ("Triple Bypass" = a bike race, not surgery).
- Chips always render canonical `nameById[id]`, never the model's raw spelling; `.trim()` before name matching.
- Prompts must explicitly require a notes row for every "X was there" mention — attendance IS the note link.
- **PostgREST:** 2 FKs to one table ⇒ qualify embeds (`table!constraint`) or every consumer errors; `.eq()` on an embedded resource filters the embed's own rows — use two queries when you need the full related set. Nested-join TS types lie about cardinality — trust the schema, cast `as unknown as T`.
- `verbatimModuleSyntax`: type-only imports (`import { type X }`). Run `npm run build` locally — clean dev ≠ clean build.
- Vercel env changes need a fresh redeploy (build-time baking). Pushes absent (not failed) from Vercel's deploy list ⇒ check vercel-status.com; CLI is the fallback.
- Prompt-cache guards: stable-first/volatile-last, no timestamps/UUIDs in system prompts, deterministic JSON serialization, explicit `.order()` everywhere (§5).
- A Key Facts name with no chip = the name didn't uniquely resolve (dupe person or ambiguous name in the source note) — that's the signal, not a rendering bug.
- Before loosening any name-matching/confidence check, grep PROJECT_HISTORY for why it was added first — `person-facts`'s exact-full-name-match rule looks overly strict in isolation but exists specifically to stop a real false-positive (Gus/Olivia, 2026-07-19); "unambiguous in the roster" ≠ "confirmed identity," since the named person may not be in the system at all.
- Fix classes of bugs, not instances: `converse`'s siblings (`update-moment`/`update-group`) have repeatedly harbored the same bug (JSON fences, max_tokens, silent errors, missing rosters) — when one function gets a reliability fix, check them all. Same for the two independent name-resolution paths (`relationships.ts` and `person-facts`).
- **A confident match and a confirmed suggestion must write the exact same both-sides notes** — `relationships.ts`'s direct-write path did, but `RelationshipSuggestions.tsx`'s confirm handlers only ever wrote onto the newly linked/created person, never back onto the subject, until fixed 2026-07-20 (found via the Sucre-brothers inconsistent-siblings report: whichever profile the fact was typed on could end up with nothing). Any new relationship-suggestion type needs the same both-sides write, not just the "obvious" direction.
- **A "does this note already exist" dedupe check must match the EXACT deterministic text, never a loose "mentions this name + a family-shaped keyword" heuristic** — the loose version (`relationships.ts`, fixed 2026-07-20) false-positived on the SUBJECT's own original sentence (e.g. "Her siblings are Clare, Bridget, and Patrick" already contains "Clare" + the word "siblings"), silently blocking the subject from ever getting their OWN reciprocal note while everyone else correctly got theirs pointing back at them — found via the Berzins-family report, where Caroline (the one person who'd actually typed the fact) was the one left incomplete, not her siblings.
- **Display text derived from a navigation-time prop (breadcrumb label) goes stale the moment the underlying record is renamed mid-visit** — `PersonDetail.tsx` had every nudge/fact-bar/banner string keyed off the `personName` prop instead of the freshly-loaded `person` state, invisible until the manual "add person" flow (2026-07-20) made same-visit renames the common case instead of the rare one. Any page with an in-place rename control needs its own display text to track live state, not what it was called when you navigated in.
- **A blank-shell record's cached AI summary can be generated against its placeholder name/content before it's ever filled in** — `GroupDetail.tsx`'s rename didn't invalidate the cached summary (only membership changes did), so a manually-created group (2026-07-20) could get summarized as "New group" and stay that way forever. Any manual-create-then-fill-in flow needs its rename/edit paths to invalidate the same caches the AI-driven paths already do.
